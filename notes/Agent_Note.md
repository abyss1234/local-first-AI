RAG is an augmentation generation system developed by the RACI initiative for Android apps. It enables users to retrieve information from multiple sources, such as a device's API key, its own profile, and even the on-call engineer's response. The system is designed to provide a user with additional features without disrupting their normal life or causing them undue stress.
